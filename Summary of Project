I helped clean the dataset with all group members. I also worked on the visualization of the 'Growth of EV Registrations and Yearly Change in California.'

Additionally, I provided ideas for forecasting EV registrations, and my whole team decided to add second-degree and third-degree polynomial forecasts eventually.(Chenhui Shen)
